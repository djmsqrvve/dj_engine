## 🙋 SUPPORT & HELP

**If you're stuck:**

1. Use INDEX_Navigation_Guide.md → "By Question: Find Your Answer"
2. Check Architecture_Specification.json for reference
3. Use a prompt from AI_Coding_Assistant_Config.md
4. Paste into Cursor or Claude for detailed explanation

**If you want to extend:**

1. Follow phased approach (don't skip phases)
2. Maintain JSON serialization (for content creators)
3. Use Lua for game logic (not Bevy code changes)
4. Profile before optimizing (Bevy Remote Protocol)
