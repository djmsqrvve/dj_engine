# Clone/download all files
git clone <dj_engine repo>
cd dj_engine

# Week 1: Setup
cat Implementation_Summary.md
cat IDE_Configuration_Guide.md
cp -r IDE_Configuration_Guide.md/.vscode .vscode/

# Week 2-3: Learn Architecture
less Game_Engine_Technical_Roadmap.md
# (Read sections 1-3, take notes)

# Week 4: Start Coding
cargo init
# Copy code from Roadmap section 1.2 (StoryNode enum)
# Copy code from Roadmap section 1.4 (story_advancement_system)
cargo build

# Weeks 5-20: Implement phases
# Reference Roadmap for each phase
# Use AI_Coding_Assistant_Config.md for debugging
```

### As a Team Lead

```bash
# Day 1: Distribute documents
share Implementation_Summary.md with whole team
share IDE_Configuration_Guide.md with all developers

# Day 2: Architecture review (1-2 hours)
team meeting: review Roadmap "5 Critical Decisions" (Section 5)
discussion: confirm approach aligns with your goals

# Day 3: Assign roles
solo dev → phases 1-2, then 3-4
tools dev → phases 1-5 (editor tools)

# Weekly: Progress tracking
use Architecture_Specification.json deliverables_checklist
report: which phase is complete, what's blockers
```

### As a Content Creator (Later Phase 5)

```bash
# When Story Graph visual editor is ready:
open editor
read Roadmap Section 1.2 (StoryNodeType enum) for features
create story graphs by dragging nodes
export to JSON
commit to git

# When Lua API is ready:
read AI_Coding_Assistant_Config.md (Lua bindings section)
write Lua scripts using unit:*, party:*, trigger_* functions
test in both DoomExe and RTS
iterate
```

## 📞 GETTING HELP

### If you're stuck on...

**Rust syntax errors?**
→ Use Cursor with "Show compilation error explanation"  
→ Or: Paste error in ChatGPT/Claude with code context

**Bevy ECS concepts?**
→ Read Bevy official docs (links in IDE Guide)  
→ Watch FOSDEM 2026 presentation (linked above)

**Story Graph architecture?**
→ Re-read Roadmap Section 1.2-1.4 (carefully)  
→ Or: Prompt Claude: "Why is StoryNodeType an enum instead of a trait?"

**Lua integration issues?**
→ Check mlua docs: https://docs.rs/mlua/  
→ Use AI prompt from AI_Coding_Assistant_Config.md Section 5 (Prompt 3)

**Performance bottlenecks?**
→ Follow profiling steps in IDE_Configuration_Guide.md Section 9  
→ Use Bevy's built-in diagnostics system

**Team coordination?**
→ Use Architecture_Specification.json as reference  
→ Hold weekly standup on Implementation_Summary.md phases
