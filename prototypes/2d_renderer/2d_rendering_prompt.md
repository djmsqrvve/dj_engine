# Prompt: Bevy 2D Rendering Sandbox

"I want to build a lightweight 2D rendering prototype using the Bevy game engine. The project should be a standalone crate that focuses on high-quality 2D aesthetics and performance.

### Core Requirements:
1. **Tech Stack:** Bevy (latest), Rust.
2. **Features to Implement:**
    - **Animated Sprites:** Implement a simple sprite sheet animator for a protagonist character.
    - **Parallax Background:** At least 3 layers of scrolling background to create depth.
    - **2D Lighting:** A simple point light following the mouse or player, using `bevy_sprite` or a crate like `bevy-point-light-2d`.
    - **Tilemap Support:** Use `bevy_ecs_tilemap` to render a basic room or terrain.
    - **Camera Control:** Smooth camera follow with zoom capabilities.
3. **Visual Style:** 'Mint Cyberpunk' aesthetic—neon greens, deep purples, and subtle glows.
4. **Structure:** Follow 'One Concern per File' (state.rs, systems.rs, ui/).

Please generate the `Cargo.toml` and a basic `main.rs` that sets up these systems."
